The main task of the event was divided into 3 parts namely: assembling the jumbled circuit, component identification and simulation of the assembled circuit. The teams were evaluated on the basis of the progress made in these 3 phases by an industry level expert. The team with the highest number of points at the end of three phases was declared the winner.
        The teams were allotted questions on the basis of a Lucky draw. The questions were application based which included assembling jumbled set of parts of circuit diagram in Phase I. For Phase II teams were given the task to identify electronics components.Phase III was based on simulation of the respective circuit diagram on NI Multisim. At the end of Phase III a quiz was conducted on moodle platform.
