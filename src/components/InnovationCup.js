    participants are encouraged to think beyond profit-making
    and contribute to society by developing solutions to these
    critical social problems.
    The event ties in with the core values of the institute, which
    focuses on developing innovative and socially responsible
    engineers. The department aims to provide students with
    the knowledge and skills necessary to develop cutting-edge
    technologies that addresses real-world problems. The
    Innovation Cup is an opportunity for students to put their
    skills and knowledge into practice and contribute to society
    by developing innovative hardware solutions that aims to
    solve social issues of the citizens at the bottom of social

<h3 className="innovation">Round 1 (Ideation Round) : 20 Marks</h3>
The teams are free to choose any domain or domains and identify a problem
statement that deals with the problems faced by the community in those
domains. Once the problem statement is identified by the team, they are
expected to frame an abstract on the solution and submit it along with the
resumes of all the team members. The resume should highlight the details of
the technical events in which the team members have participated
previously. The evaluation result of this round will be communicated to the
teams selected for round 2 based on submitted abstract only.
Please Note: The teams with relatively more innovative problem statements,
solutions and resumes will have a better chance of qualifying for round 2. All
certificates mentioned need to be submitted if required.
<br />
<h3 className="innovation">Round 2 (Assessment Round) : 30 Marks</h3>
Round 2 will be divided in two phases.
PHASE 1: The selected teams are required to work on a live problem
statement which would be provided by the organisers, it will involve the use
of technical skills in the domain of circuit design, troubleshooting, testing
and demonstrating PCB design using any CAD tool.
PHASE 2: The participants are expected to present a PPT (not more than 10
slides, including introductory and closing slide) for the abstract
product/idea that they came up with in the 1st round. The PPT must include
Problem Statement, Objective, Motivation, Block Diagram, Methodology,
Target Audience, Market Survey, Tentative Budget. Based on the score of
round 2, best 10 teams will be selected for round 3.
<br />
<h3 className="innovation">Round 3 (Final Round) : 50 Marks</h3>
The selected teams will be given a budget of ₹5,000 in order to build a
prototype of the idea that they proposed in round 1, it will be then later
judged on it's innovation, cost effectivity, the impact of the product for the
citizens at the bottom of the social ladder and other industry parameters
set by the judges. A complete breakdown of expenses is also required to
be produced by the teams for their idea.
Top 3 selected teams' ideas will be patented in the name of their
institute/institutes along with SPIT and SP TBI.</p>
